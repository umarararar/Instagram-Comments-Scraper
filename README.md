Instagram Comment Scraper
This repository contains a Python script that scrapes the comments of an Instagram post using Selenium and prints them on the terminal.

Usage
To use this script, you'll need to have Python and the Selenium library installed on your system. You'll also need to download and install a compatible web driver for your preferred browser.

Once you've set up your environment, you can run the script by executing python scrape_comments.py in your terminal. The script will prompt you to enter the post URL.
